                <p class="childhood-text">You know those kids who couldn't decide between art class and math club? That was me. I'd be scribbling doodles all over my math homework, then flip the page and lose myself in equations. Weird combo, right? But turns out, it was perfect prep for what I do now - creating digital experiences that just click with people.
                  <br>
                My path here wasn't exactly a straight line. I started out as a test engineer at Accenture (snooze, I know), but something felt off. Then I stumbled into UI/UX design, and bam! It was like finding the last piece of a puzzle I didn't even know I was solving.
                Fast forward through a gig at Samsung and a deep dive into design at Langara College, and here I am in Vancouver, still geeking out over making tech feel more human. And loving every minute of it.</p>

            <p class="harsimran-wireframing-text">Here's a secret: I'm a bit of a chatterbox. I'm that guy who ends up hearing someone's life story in the checkout line. But you know what? It makes me great at user research. When people get comfy, the real gold comes out - and that's where the design magic happens.
              When I'm not in front of my computer, you'll probably find me with my camera, trying to capture BC's ridiculous beauty. Or halfway up a mountain, wondering why on earth I thought this hike was a good idea (spoiler: the view always makes it worth it).</p>

            <p>So, if you're into creating stuff that makes life a bit easier or a lot more fun, give me a shout. I'm always up for a good chat, a new challenge, or swapping trail recommendations. Let's make something awesome together! </p>
